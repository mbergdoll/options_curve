# options_curve

It is an implementation to modelize an option payoff with the Black - Scholes model.

# The Black Scholes Formula parameters
'''
  Call_or_Put - This is set to 'call' for call option, anything else for put
  S - Stock price
  K - Strike price
  T - Time to maturity
  r - Riskfree interest rate
  d - Dividend yield
  v - Volatility

We note that the graph is near to the theoretical curve of an option. It shows that the model represents well the reality.
